# Simpliest Pastebin

Fast and reliable pastebin solution that just works and is built with focus on security and simplicity.

Based upon the original Knoxious Open Pastebin by Xan Manning.

## Annotation

There are a lot of pastbin solutions out there that are reliable and works well. But they are complicated, and focused on creation of sites with registrations, tags, lists of recent items, etc.

This project is absolutely different. It should be simple. And it should be secure. Nothing more.

There are two reason of why it was based upon Knoxious Open Pastebin:

1. It is desirable to preserve the original format of stored pastes.
2. I'm lazy. ;)

## Features

* Line Highlighting
* Editing pastes, history
* Robot Spam protection
* Paste privacy settings
* Paste lifespan settings

## Server requirements

1. A webserver or web hosting account running on any major Operating System
2. PHP (5.3 and above)
